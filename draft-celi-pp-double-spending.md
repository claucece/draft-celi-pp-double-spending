--- abstract

Privacy Pass is a protocol that aims to provide an anonymity-preserving
mechanism for authorization of clients with servers. The protocol is
detailed in {{?I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol}} and is intended for use in
the application-layer.

Privacy Pass requires a protection against double-spending: a mechanism
for checking that tokens sent by clients have not been spent before.
All issuing servers should implement this robust storage-query mechanism.

This document specifies the needs and protection that such mechanism should
have, and the attacks that can be exercised upon in.

# Introduction

Note that this draft has not received significant security review and should
not be the basis for production systems.

Needs:

* Tokens need to be checked for each server individually.
* All servers must perform global double-spend checks to avoid clients from
  exploiting the possibility of spending tokens more than once against
  distributed token checking systems
* The storage needs to have a quick update time. While an update is occurring
  it may be possible for a malicious client to spend a token more than once.
* The storage should be parameterized to live as long as the server keypair
  that is in use.

Attacks:

* There could be double-spending during the update
* A malicious redeemer could induce the double-spending storage to store large
  numbers of tokens, possibly causing denial-of-service due to consuming
  storage space.
* An attacker can compromise the double-spending storage and remove used
  tokens, so token can be re-accepted at a later time.
