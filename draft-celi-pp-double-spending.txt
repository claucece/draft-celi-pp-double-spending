                    Double Spending in Privacy Pass
                  draft-celi-pp-double-spending-latest

Abstract

   Privacy Pass is a protocol that aims to provide an anonymity-
   preserving mechanism for authorization of clients with servers.  The
   protocol is detailed in [I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol] and is
   intended for use in the application-layer.

   Privacy Pass requires a protection against double-spending: a
   mechanism for checking that tokens sent by clients have not been
   spent before.  All issuing servers should implement this robust
   storage-query mechanism.

   This document specifies the needs and protection that such mechanism
   should have, and the attacks that can be exercised upon in.

1.  Introduction

   Note that this draft has not received significant security review and
   should not be the basis for production systems.

   Needs:

   *  Tokens need to be checked for each server individually.

   *  All servers must perform global double-spend checks to avoid
      clients from exploiting the possibility of spending tokens more
      than once against distributed token checking systems

   *  The storage needs to have a quick update time.  While an update is
      occurring it may be possible for a malicious client to spend a
      token more than once.

   *  The storage should be parameterized to live as long as the server
      keypair that is in use.

   Attacks:

   *  There could be double-spending during the update

   *  A malicious redeemer could induce the double-spending storage to
      store large numbers of tokens, possibly causing denial-of-service
      due to consuming storage space.

   *  An attacker can compromise the double-spending storage and remove
      used tokens, so token can be re-accepted at a later time.
